# Monty-Hall-Game
The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall.

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? 

Well according to probability theory it is always advantageous to switch as when you pick the door for the first time there is one third of chance that you picked the door which has a car but when you switch the chance increases to two third.

So in the long run you will see that you are going home with a car when you switch your choice.
